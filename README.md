# UFOs

## Purpose Of Project
To update Dana's webpage to allow users to filter for multiple criteria and provide a more concise UFO sightings data.

## Results
With the update to the index.html file, we are now able to filter other criteria including Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. This allows the users to adjust their search parameters. For example, the user wants to search for sightings on a given date 1/7/2010 in the state of Massachusetts:
